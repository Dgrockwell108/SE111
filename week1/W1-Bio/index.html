        <p1>I am 24 years old, born October 8th, 1997, i live in Carver, Massachusetts with my beautiful girlfriend and our two dogs. I bought my first house at 22 year sold in 2020. After a long time away from school and wondering what i wanted to do in life, i decided that i wanted to go back to school and further my education to become more successful in life. I realised that my happiness is derived from my success. I live with my beautiful girlfriend Ashley, who goes to Lasell University for Sports managment and chasing her masters degree, we also have two dogs, Gwen and Amelia.</p1>
