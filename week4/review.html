    <h2>REVIEW</h2>
    <p><b>Dakota Rockwell</b> February 21, 2022</p>
    <br>
    <p>Saving Private Ryan is a war darma that follows soliders during The Invasion of D-Day, this movie starts at the end of the movie showing us an aged character that we do not know yet looking over the cemetary that is now the resting place to thousands of soldiers who lost their lives during the invasion. We then cut right to the invasion, introducing our characters. This movie does not skip on any aspects of the realism of brutality of war, this movie was actually rated so realistic for their adaption of the invasion of D-Day that the department of veteran affairs set up a phone line for veterans who went and watched the movie, just in case it was too much for them to watch. The movie follows our characters on their mission to find James Ryan a private who landed piror to the invasion with the airborne division, the reason they are tasked with finding this one man is because due to the sad reality and brutality of war, all three of his brothers died during the invasion on the beach, and Ryan is being sent back home. This movie has it all, action, sadness, heroics, and beautiful music and scenery. I saw this movie as a child and it became my all time favorite movie since then. I think all the actors who are very famous in hollywood, made good apearances here, worked hard, showed off their incredible skill and talent.</p>
    <br>
    <p>My Favorite character in this movie is Capt Miller who is played by Tom Hanks, as a child when you see and recognize Tom Hanks in a movie you know its going to be good. This is definitley a famous role of his, and helped him move further to continue rolls in different military movies.</p>

    <h2>Trivia</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Did you know that this movie was depicted to be so realistic that the department of veteran affairs made a hotline for people to call in case of their PTSD becoming too much to handle</li>
            <li>All the Principal actors except for Matt Damon, underwent grueling army traning for several days, Damon was spared so that the other actors would resent him and would convey that feeling in their performances</li>
            <li>The two "German" soldiers who are shot trying to surrender were actually speaking CZech. They were saying "please dont shoot me, i am not German, i am Czech, i didnt kill anyone, i am Czech!" They were conscripted by the German army, apart of a specific battalion of mostly Czech men taken prisoner in Eastern Europe</li>
